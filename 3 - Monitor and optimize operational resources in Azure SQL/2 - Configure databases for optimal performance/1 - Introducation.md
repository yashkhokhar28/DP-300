## üîç **What is this about?**

Even though SQL Server runs in the cloud (**Azure SQL Database** or **SQL Server on an Azure Virtual Machine**), database administrators (DBAs) **still need to optimize and maintain the databases** to ensure fast and reliable performance.

Microsoft has added **new features** and **better tuning options** in recent versions of SQL Server and Azure SQL to help make this easier.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Key Concepts Explained**

### 1. **Database Scoped Configurations**

- Older versions of SQL Server used **instance-level settings**, which applied to **all databases**.
- Now, many performance and behavior settings can be configured **per database**, providing **more control and flexibility**.

‚û°Ô∏è Example: You can change how queries behave or how certain features work **just for a single database**, without affecting others.

### 2. **Maintenance Tasks: Indexing and Statistics**

- Even in Azure, you need to regularly:

  - **Update statistics**: Helps the query optimizer make good decisions about query plans.
  - **Rebuild or reorganize indexes**: Keeps data access fast by preventing fragmentation.

These are standard maintenance tasks to keep query performance optimal.

### 3. **Intelligent Query Processing (IQP)**

- A **modern feature set** in SQL Server and Azure SQL that allows the database to **automatically optimize query performance** without manual tuning.
- It includes features like:

  - Adaptive joins
  - Memory grant feedback
  - Batch mode processing
  - Automatic tuning of some query patterns

- The database learns over time and adjusts how queries are executed.

---

### 4. **Automatic Tuning in Azure**

- Azure SQL Database includes **built-in automatic tuning**.

  - Example: Azure can **automatically create, drop, or adjust indexes** and apply query plan corrections if it detects performance issues.
  - This reduces the workload for DBAs.

## üéØ **Learning Objectives of This Module**

You'll learn:

- How to configure **database-level performance settings**.
- How to manage **indexes and statistics** to avoid slow queries.
- How **Intelligent Query Processing (IQP)** works to optimize queries.
- How Azure's **Automatic Tuning** can make performance improvements automatically.

---

## ‚úÖ **Summary**

This introduction sets up the importance of:

- Proactively managing database performance in Azure.
- Understanding modern features like IQP and automatic tuning.
- Performing regular maintenance (just like on-premises databases).
