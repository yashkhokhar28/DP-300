## üåü **What is Intelligent Query Processing (IQP)?**

Intelligent Query Processing is a group of **automatic optimizations** built into SQL Server and Azure SQL. These optimizations fix common performance issues (anti-patterns) and improve execution plans, making workloads run faster **with minimal changes required from developers**.

Many IQP features require setting the database **compatibility level to 150** to activate them:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE [WideWorldImportersDW] SET COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL = 150;
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Main IQP Feature Families**

### 1. üîß **Adaptive Query Processing**

These features allow SQL Server to **adjust query execution plans dynamically**, depending on what happens at runtime.

- **Adaptive Joins**: SQL Server waits until it knows how many rows a join will process, then chooses the most efficient join type (**Hash Join** or **Nested Loops**).
  ‚û§ Example: If few rows are returned, it uses Nested Loops; otherwise, it uses Hash Join.
  ‚û§ Works only in **batch mode**.

- **Interleaved Execution (for MSTVFs)**:

  - MSTVFs (**Multi-Statement Table-Valued Functions**) used to assume they returned 1 or 100 rows, leading to poor plans.
  - Now, SQL Server **runs the MSTVF first to get the actual row count**, and then optimizes the remaining query based on that number.

- **Memory Grant Feedback**:

  - SQL Server estimates how much memory a query needs.
  - If it guesses wrong (too much or too little), the query might fail or be inefficient.
  - Memory Grant Feedback adjusts the memory for future executions to avoid spills to **tempdb** or wasting memory.

### 2. üìà **Table Variable Deferred Compilation**

Previously, **table variables** always assumed they had **only one row**, which often gave SQL Server a bad estimate for how to execute queries.
Now, SQL Server **waits until the query runs to count the actual rows** before compiling the query plan, giving more accurate plans.

---

### 3. ‚öôÔ∏è **Batch Mode on Rowstore**

Batch mode was originally only for **columnstore indexes**, but now **rowstore tables** (regular tables) can also process rows in batches.
This improves CPU efficiency, especially for queries with:

- Aggregations
- Sorts
- Joins

Batch processing reduces overhead by handling **multiple rows at a time** instead of one by one.

---

### 4. üîç **Scalar UDF Inlining**

Scalar **user-defined functions (UDFs)** used to run slowly because:

- They were executed **once per row** (very inefficient).
- They couldn't participate in parallelism.
- Their cost wasn‚Äôt properly estimated in query plans.

Now, SQL Server **inlines scalar UDFs directly into the query plan** as subqueries, making them faster and parallelizable.

---

### 5. üî¢ **Approximate Count Distinct**

Doing a `COUNT(DISTINCT column)` on large tables is slow.

The new `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT()` function gives you a **fast estimate** with:

- \~2% error margin
- 97% confidence
- Much faster results for large datasets (great for analytics)
