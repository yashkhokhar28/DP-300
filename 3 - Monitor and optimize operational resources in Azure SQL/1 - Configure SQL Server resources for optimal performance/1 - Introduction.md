### üåü **What‚Äôs the Main Challenge?**

When running **SQL Server in Azure**, admins must **balance two key things**:

1. **Performance** ‚Äî Make sure the system runs fast enough for your applications.
2. **Cost** ‚Äî Avoid overspending on resources you don‚Äôt need.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Key Configuration Areas in Azure SQL Server**

| Configuration Area            | Why It‚Äôs Important                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Azure Storage**             | SQL Server performance depends heavily on **storage speed and size**. Choosing the right disk type (Premium SSD, Standard SSD, etc.) can make a big difference in query performance.                  |
| **Virtual Machine (VM) Size** | Bigger VM = More CPU & Memory = Better performance, but higher cost. Selecting the right VM series (e.g., **D-series**, **E-series**) is important for your workload.                                 |
| **TempDB Configuration**      | **TempDB** is a system database used for temporary objects and sorting. If not configured well (right number of data files, correct size), it becomes a bottleneck in performance.                    |
| **Resource Governor**         | A SQL Server feature to control how much CPU and memory different workloads use. Especially useful for **multitenant environments** where different apps or customers share the same database server. |
