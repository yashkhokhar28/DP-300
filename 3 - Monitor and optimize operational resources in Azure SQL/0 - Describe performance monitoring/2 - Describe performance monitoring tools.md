## üìä **Core Concept:**

Azure provides **different monitoring tools** depending on **what you're monitoring**:

- **Azure Virtual Machine (VM) metrics**: Operating system and infrastructure-level metrics.
- **SQL Server metrics**: Database-level metrics, which require **separate monitoring inside the VM.**

## üîç **Key Tools & Features Explained**

| **Tool/Concept**                                 | **Purpose**                         | **What It Monitors**                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Azure Monitor**                                | Default monitoring tool in Azure    | Basic **OS-level VM metrics** like CPU, Disk I/O, Network usage.                                                   |
| **Monitoring Insights (Azure Monitor Insights)** | Adds **deeper monitoring** for VMs  | Extra metrics like storage latency, available memory, and disk capacity.                                           |
| **Azure Log Analytics Workspace**                | Stores and queries logs and metrics | Stores data collected from Azure Monitor and Insights. Use **KQL** (Kusto Query Language) to query logs.           |
| **SQL VM Resource Provider**                     | Adds SQL-specific management to VMs | Lets you manage **SQL-specific features** like automated patching, and view database file sizes from Azure portal. |
| **Performance Monitor (Perfmon)**                | Native Windows Server tool          | Collects both OS and **SQL Server performance counters**. Can forward results to Azure Monitor.                    |

## ‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works in an Azure Virtual Machine:**

1. **Basic Metrics (via Azure Monitor):**

   - When you deploy a VM from Azure Marketplace, it comes with an **agent** that automatically sends basic metrics (CPU, Disk I/O, Network) to **Azure Monitor**.
   - These are **host-level metrics**, not specific to SQL Server.

2. **Detailed OS Metrics (with Monitoring Insights):**

   - You can enable **Monitoring Insights** for more detailed performance data, like disk latency and memory usage.
   - This data is stored in **Azure Log Analytics**, and can be queried using **KQL**.

3. **SQL Server-Specific Metrics:**

   - By default, **Azure Monitor does NOT show SQL Server internal performance metrics**.
   - To monitor SQL-specific metrics, you must:

     - Either **install the SQL VM Resource Provider**, which gives some visibility in the Azure portal.
     - Or **log into the VM and use native tools** like **Performance Monitor (perfmon)**.

4. **Performance Monitor (Perfmon):**

   - Works **both on-premises and in Azure VMs**.
   - Allows you to add SQL Server counters (e.g., buffer cache hit ratio, batch requests/sec) and track them.
   - You can save these results locally or **push them to Azure Monitor** to centralize your monitoring.

## ‚úÖ **Key Takeaways:**

- Azure Monitor gives **basic VM metrics**, but **not SQL metrics**.
- To monitor SQL Server:

  - Use **Performance Monitor inside the VM**, or
  - Register the **SQL VM Resource Provider** if using a SQL Server image from the Azure Marketplace.

- All data can be centralized in **Azure Monitor + Log Analytics** for easier long-term analysis.
