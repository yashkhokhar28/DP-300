### üìå **Main Idea:**

When you move a database to **Azure SQL (cloud)**, performance monitoring remains a **critical responsibility** of a **Database Administrator (DBA)**, even though some **hardware-level controls** (common in on-premises environments) are no longer available. As a DBA, you must understand how to **monitor**, **diagnose**, and **optimize performance issues** using the tools Azure provides.

### ‚úÖ **Key Learning Objectives Explained:**

| Learning Objective                      | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Review potential performance issues** | Learn how to identify symptoms of poor database performance (e.g., slow queries, resource bottlenecks).                                                                       |
| **Identify critical Azure metrics**     | Understand which Azure resource metrics (CPU, DTU, IOPS, etc.) and SQL database metrics matter most for monitoring performance.                                               |
| **Collect metrics for a baseline**      | Learn how to collect normal operating metrics so that future problems can be compared against this "baseline" for easier troubleshooting.                                     |
| **Use Extended Events for analysis**    | Gain skills in using **Extended Events**, a lightweight performance monitoring and troubleshooting tool in SQL Server and Azure SQL, for in-depth query performance analysis. |
| **Understand Database Watcher**         | Learn about **Azure SQL Database Watcher**, a newer monitoring tool designed to simplify database performance monitoring and observability.                                   |

### üõ°Ô∏è **Key Takeaway:**

You still need **active performance management in Azure SQL**, but you rely more on **platform-provided monitoring tools** and **cloud metrics**, rather than hardware-level tuning. Mastering Azure's tools will help you quickly detect and resolve bottlenecks.
