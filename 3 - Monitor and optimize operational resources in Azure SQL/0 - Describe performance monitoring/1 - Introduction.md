## üîç **Key Points Explained**

### ‚úîÔ∏è **Performance Monitoring is Still Essential in the Cloud**

- In an **on-premises environment**, DBAs manage the **hardware, OS, and SQL Server settings**.
- In **Azure SQL**, Microsoft manages the hardware and much of the infrastructure.
- As a DBA, you **lose direct control over the hardware**, but you are still responsible for ensuring your **databases run efficiently**.
- Therefore, **monitoring performance and identifying issues proactively** becomes even more important.

| **Objective**                                | **Explanation**                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Understand performance issues**            | Learn how to **identify slow queries, resource bottlenecks**, and system issues in Azure SQL.             |
| **Identify critical Azure metrics**          | Know which metrics (CPU, DTU, storage, IO, etc.) to watch in the **Azure portal or monitoring tools**.    |
| **Collect baseline metrics**                 | Establish **what "normal" performance looks like**, so you can spot problems when they occur.             |
| **Use Extended Events**                      | Analyze **deeper query and performance data** using SQL Server‚Äôs built-in diagnostics.                    |
| **Understand database watcher (DB Watcher)** | Learn about Azure SQL‚Äôs **automated monitoring services** like Intelligent Insights and Database Watcher. |

## üìà **What Will You Learn in the Next Units?**

- Tools like:

  - **Azure Monitor**
  - **SQL Insights**
  - **Query Performance Insight**
  - **Dynamic Management Views (DMVs)**
  - **Extended Events**

- How to:

  - Set up alerts for performance issues.
  - Analyze slow-running queries.
  - Optimize resource usage.
  - Compare current metrics against a baseline.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **Why This is Important**

Unlike on-prem, in Azure you cannot:

- Upgrade the CPU manually.
- Increase disk speed on the fly.
- Check physical memory performance.

‚û°Ô∏è So, you must be **proactive in monitoring performance indicators**, tuning queries, and scaling database resources as needed.

---

### ‚úÖ **Summary**

- Monitoring in Azure SQL is **critical because you have less control over the underlying hardware**.
- You'll use Azure's tools to monitor and optimize performance.
- This section prepares you to learn the **tools and techniques for tracking and improving database performance in Azure SQL.**
