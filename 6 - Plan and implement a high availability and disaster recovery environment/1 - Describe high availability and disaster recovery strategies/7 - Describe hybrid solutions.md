## üîë **What Is a Hybrid Solution?**

A **hybrid solution** connects your on-premises servers with cloud services, so you can:

- Extend your existing SQL Server HADR setup to Azure.
- Build a **Disaster Recovery (DR)** site in Azure without moving your whole system.
- Gradually **migrate to the cloud** while maintaining availability and data protection.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Key Points About Hybrid HADR in Azure**

| Aspect                  | Details                                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Type of SQL Solution    | Hybrid is **mainly IaaS (SQL Server on VMs)**, because PaaS doesn‚Äôt support hybrid HADR.         |
| Hybrid Example          | Primary SQL Server **on-premises**, secondary replica **in Azure** via Availability Groups (AG). |
| Use Cases               | - Cloud-based DR site<br>- Migration staging<br>- Scaling read-only replicas in Azure            |
| Required Infrastructure | - Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)<br>- DNS<br>- Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC)  |
| Critical Requirement    | **Networking:** High bandwidth + low latency to meet RTO & RPO goals.                            |
| Recommended Networking  | - **Azure ExpressRoute** (preferred)<br>- Site-to-site VPN (acceptable, but slower)              |
| Not Recommended         | Don‚Äôt expose SQL Server VMs directly to the public internet for security reasons.                |

## üîç **Why PaaS Can‚Äôt Be Fully Hybrid**

- **Azure SQL Database** and **Azure SQL Managed Instance (MI)** are managed by Microsoft.
- Their HA/DR is built-in and you can't extend them to on-premises servers like you can with IaaS.
- Exception: **Transactional Replication**

  - You can replicate **from an on-premises SQL Server (Publisher)** ‚ûî **to Azure SQL Managed Instance (Subscriber)**.
  - But you **can‚Äôt replicate from Azure back to on-premises**.

## üå©Ô∏è **Examples of Hybrid Scenarios**

| Scenario                      | Example Configuration                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| On-prem primary with Azure DR | Primary AG replica on-prem ‚ûî Secondary in Azure        |
| Hybrid migration              | Replicate production DBs to Azure while testing there  |
| Cold backup storage           | Send backups to Azure Blob Storage (archival DR)       |
| Read scale-out                | Primary on-prem ‚ûî Read replicas in Azure (for reports) |

## üåê **Networking Is Critical**

If your network is too slow or unreliable, you **won‚Äôt meet your RTO (recovery time) or RPO (data loss limits)**.

Recommended:

- **ExpressRoute**: A dedicated private network connection to Azure. Faster and more secure than VPN.
- **VPN Gateway (site-to-site VPN):** Less expensive, secure, but slower than ExpressRoute. Suitable for smaller setups.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Don‚Äôt expose your Azure VMs directly to the internet.** Always keep them in a private network.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è **Bonus: Azure as Backup Storage**

Even without a full hybrid DR solution, you can:

- **Back up your on-prem SQL databases to Azure Blob Storage.**
- Use Azure for **long-term cold storage of backups**, saving on costs.

---

## ‚úîÔ∏è **Summary**

- Hybrid HADR = **On-prem + Azure (IaaS)**.
- Use traditional SQL Server HA features (**AG, log shipping, FCI**) across sites.
- PaaS (Azure SQL DB / MI) generally doesn‚Äôt support hybrid HA/DR, except for **replication from on-prem to Azure MI**.
- Networking (especially **ExpressRoute or VPN**) is the most important success factor.
