## ‚úÖ **Key PaaS High Availability and Disaster Recovery Features**

| Feature                    | Available In                          | Purpose                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Auto-failover groups**   | Azure SQL Database & Managed Instance | Automatic failover between regions for DR          |
| **Active geo-replication** | Azure SQL Database only               | Create read/write replicas in other regions for DR |
| **Built-in failover**      | Azure SQL Database & Managed Instance | Automatic node replacement on hardware failure     |
| **Read replicas**          | Azure SQL Database & Managed Instance | Offload reporting; improve availability            |

## üîπ **How Azure SQL Database Handles Availability**

- Azure SQL Database has a **99.99% SLA**, meaning it‚Äôs designed for **nearly continuous uptime**.
- If the **underlying hardware fails**, Azure will:

  - Automatically **spin up a new node**.
  - **Reattach your storage**.
  - But: All active database **connections will drop**, and **any in-progress transactions are lost**.
  - Apps must implement **retry logic** to reconnect automatically ‚Äî this is a cloud app best practice.

## üîπ **Read Replicas for Performance and Availability**

- Read replicas allow:

  - Running **read-only queries** (like reports) without affecting the primary database performance.
  - Hosting **replicas in other regions** to improve availability and support regional failover.

## üîπ **Differences from SQL Server on VMs**

| Aspect                           | Azure SQL Database / MI (PaaS)        | SQL Server on IaaS (VM)   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Database OFFLINE/EMERGENCY modes | Not allowed                           | Allowed                   |
| Node failure recovery            | Automatic node failover               | You configure failover    |
| Transaction recovery             | Instant rollback with ADR             | Manual or slower rollback |
| Failover configuration           | Built-in and limited to Azure options | Fully customizable        |

## üîπ **Accelerated Database Recovery (ADR)**

- **ADR** improves how SQL Server rolls back transactions and recovers the database.
- Benefits:

  - **Instant transaction rollbacks** (even for long-running transactions).
  - Faster recovery after a crash.

- ADR is **enabled by default in PaaS** and **cannot be disabled**.
- Makes SQL database recovery **fast and reliable**, supporting the 99.99% SLA.

## üîπ **Database Consistency & Integrity Features**

Azure runs **automated integrity checks** behind the scenes:

| Feature                           | Purpose                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Automatic backups                 | Local & geo-redundant copies                           |
| Integrity checks (DBCC CHECKDB)   | Verifies database health                               |
| Lost write & stale read detection | Protects against disk-level data corruption            |
| Automatic page repair             | Self-heals damaged pages without user intervention     |
| Alerting for major issues         | Proactively notifies if a problem affects availability |

## ‚úîÔ∏è **Summary Takeaways**

- In PaaS, **Azure handles hardware-level HA/DR** ‚Äî you only manage the database-level features.
- Use **Auto-failover groups** or **geo-replication** to protect against regional outages.
- Your app must be **designed for transient faults** (handle dropped connections).
- Recovery and repair processes like ADR and automatic page repair make databases more resilient than typical on-prem SQL Server setups.
