## ✅ **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):**

> **"How long can the business afford to be down?"**

- **Definition:**
  The **maximum time allowed** to restore services after an outage.

- **Example:**
  If your RTO is **30 minutes**, your system must be back online **within 30 minutes** of the failure.
  If it takes longer, you might face **lost productivity, financial penalties, or customer dissatisfaction.**

- **Scope:**
  RTO can apply to:

  - Entire systems (e.g., the whole database platform)
  - Individual components (e.g., a single SQL Server instance or database)

---

## ✅ **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):**

> **"How much data loss is acceptable?"**

- **Definition:**
  The **maximum age of the data** you are willing to lose when you recover from a failure.

- **Example:**
  If your RPO is **15 minutes** and a failure occurs at 10:00 AM, your data should be recoverable to **9:45 AM or later.**
  Any transactions between 9:45 and 10:00 **might be lost.**

- **Factors Affecting RPO:**
  Backup frequency and technology choice.
  For example, if backups run **every 30 minutes**, your RPO cannot be lower than 30 minutes unless you improve your backup strategy.

## ✅ **How to Define RTO and RPO:**

- **Driven by Business Needs:**
  Example: If your downtime costs **\$10,000 per hour**, you'd justify investing in a system that restores faster.

- **Set for Each Component:**
  Even if your database recovers in 5 minutes, if your app server takes 20 minutes, your **total RTO is 20 minutes.**

- **Balanced with Cost:**
  Zero downtime or zero data loss is expensive and often impractical.
  Businesses must balance between **risk** and **cost**.

- **Test Your Assumptions:**
  If your backup takes 3 hours but your RTO is 2 hours, your plan is **not realistic**.

## ✅ **HA vs DR: Different Recovery Goals**

| **Aspect** | **High Availability (HA)**                    | **Disaster Recovery (DR)**               |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Scope      | Local failover (same region/data center)      | Entire site/data center failure recovery |
| Example    | Failover in an Azure region (seconds/minutes) | New data center activation (hours+)      |
| RTO/RPO    | Shorter (seconds to minutes)                  | Longer (hours or more)                   |

---

## ✅ **Final Points:**

- RTO & RPO must be **realistic** and **tested regularly.**
- Document your RTO & RPO values and **review them periodically**.
- Your choice of technologies (e.g., **Always On Availability Groups, Failover Clusters**) should align with your goals.
