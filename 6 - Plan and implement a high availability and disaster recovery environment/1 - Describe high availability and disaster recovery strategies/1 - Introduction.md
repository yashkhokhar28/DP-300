### **What It’s Saying:**

When you set up **HADR**, it’s not enough to just turn on some features. You need to:

- **Understand why you're using them.**
- **Choose the right options** for your business needs.

For example:

- If you're running SQL Server on a **virtual machine (VM)**, you should know:

  - **How long you can afford downtime** before the system must be back online (**Recovery Time Objective**, or RTO).
  - Which **HADR technologies in SQL Server** (such as Always On availability groups, Failover Clustering, Backup to Azure, etc.) are appropriate for your scenario.

---

### **Purpose of the Module:**

By completing this training module, you'll learn the **foundations for implementing HADR** solutions in **Azure SQL environments**, helping you:

- Make better decisions for protecting your databases against downtime or data loss.
- Choose the right technologies for **recovery and failover**.

---

### **What’s Next:**

The next lesson is about understanding:

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)** – How fast you recover.
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** – How much data loss you can tolerate.
