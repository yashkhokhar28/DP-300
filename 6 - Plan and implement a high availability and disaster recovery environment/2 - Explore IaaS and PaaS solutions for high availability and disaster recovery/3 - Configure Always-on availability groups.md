## ‚úÖ **1. Configuring Always On Availability Groups in Azure**

Setting up **Availability Groups (AGs)** in Azure follows the **same general process as on-premises**, but there are Azure-specific networking and storage considerations.

### **Steps to Configure an AG in Azure:**

- **Enable AG Feature in SQL Server:**

  - Done through **SQL Server Configuration Manager** or PowerShell:

    ```powershell
    Enable-SqlAlwaysOn -ServerInstance "InstanceName"
    ```

  - Requires restarting SQL Server service.

- **Create the Availability Group:**

  - Can be done using:

    - SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
    - Transact-SQL (T-SQL)
    - PowerShell.

### **Important Azure Considerations:**

- **Internal Load Balancer (ILB):**

  - Required for AG **listener** functionality in Azure.
  - Needed because Azure networking differs from physical networks.
  - Listener enables apps/users to connect without knowing the replica‚Äôs actual node.

- **Load Balancer Probe Port:**

  - Each listener IP needs a **probe port**, such as 59999.
  - Set the probe port using PowerShell:

    ```powershell
    Get-ClusterResource IPAddressResourceNameForListener | Set-ClusterParameter ProbePort 59999
    ```

  - This lets the Azure Load Balancer know which node is active.

- **Multi-Subnet Considerations:**

  - If your AG spans multiple subnets or regions, each needs a separate ILB and probe port.

- **Verifying Listener:**

  - Use PowerShell to test listener connectivity:

    ```powershell
    Test-NetConnection ListenerNameOrIP -Port ListenerPort
    ```

## ‚úÖ **2. Distributed Availability Groups (Distributed AGs)**

- **Distributed AG** spans **two separate AGs**, often in different clusters or regions.
- Used for **multi-region disaster recovery**.
- In Azure, each region needs its own **load balancer configured with port 5022** (default endpoint).
- Distributed AG doesn‚Äôt require a Windows Failover Cluster (WSFC) for the whole environment ‚Äî each AG is independent.

## ‚úÖ **3. Azure Site Recovery (ASR) as a DR Solution**

Azure Site Recovery (ASR) is a **platform-level disaster recovery solution** that works at the **VM level**, not specifically at the SQL Server database level.

### **How it Works:**

- Replicates **entire VMs** and their disks to another Azure region.
- Automatically captures changes on disks as they happen.
- **Doesn't understand SQL Server transactions**, so:

  - It can‚Äôt guarantee that your database will be consistent at the transaction level.
  - However, it provides **crash-consistent recovery points every 5 minutes**.

### **When to Use ASR:**

- You can‚Äôt (or don‚Äôt want to) deploy a SQL Server-based HADR solution like AGs or log shipping.
- You want a **simple DR plan** for **multiple VMs**, not just SQL Server.
- You want to **protect against ransomware** ‚Äî roll back the VM to a point before infection.

### **ASR Limitations for SQL Server:**

- Since ASR replicates disk changes, it may **lose uncommitted transactions**.
- The **App-consistent snapshots** use **Volume Shadow Service (VSS)**, which briefly freezes disk I/O ‚Äî this might affect SQL Server if not tuned properly.
- If failover happens, the newly activated VMs in the secondary region **aren‚Äôt protected until you re-enable replication.**

## üîç **4. Multi-VM Consistency Option in ASR**

If your app spans multiple VMs (e.g., SQL Server + app server), you can configure them for **multi-VM crash-consistent recovery**, but:

- It adds **performance overhead**.
- Only use it if you **really need to recover multiple VMs to the same recovery point**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Summary of Options**

| Feature                            | Type                      | Primary Purpose                       | RPO/RTO Quality | SQL Aware |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------- |
| Always On Availability Groups (AG) | SQL Server in-guest HA/DR | High Availability & Disaster Recovery | Excellent       | Yes       |
| Distributed Availability Groups    | SQL Server in-guest DR    | Multi-region Disaster Recovery        | Excellent       | Yes       |
| Azure Site Recovery (ASR)          | Azure platform-level DR   | VM-level Disaster Recovery            | Good for VM DR  | No        |

---

### üîî **Best Practice Tip:**

For **mission-critical SQL workloads**, prefer **AGs or distributed AGs**.
Use **Azure Site Recovery** for **simple DR protection at the VM level**, or when a database-centric approach is too complex.
