## ‚úÖ **What Are Auto-Failover Groups?**

Auto-failover groups are a **built-in high availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR) solution** in **Azure SQL Database** and **Azure SQL Managed Instance**.
They allow you to:

- Automatically replicate your databases to another region (**geo-replication**).
- Automatically or manually fail over your databases if something goes wrong in the primary region.

## üîç **Key Features of Auto-Failover Groups**

| Feature              | Description                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Supported in         | **Azure SQL Database & Azure SQL Managed Instance**                                                        |
| Failover             | Automatic or manual failover to a secondary region                                                         |
| Listener support     | Provides a **read-write listener** and a **read-only listener**                                            |
| Transparent failover | Applications connect using a **listener name** (DNS-based). No need to manually update connection strings. |
| Scope                | Supports **multiple databases** in one group                                                               |
| Unique name          | The failover group has a **unique name** in the `*.database.windows.net` domain                            |

---

## üéØ **How It Works**

- The **primary server** hosts the read-write copy of your databases.
- The **secondary server** (in another region) hosts a **read-only copy**, which stays in sync asynchronously.
- In the event of a failure in the primary region, Azure:

  - Fails over the databases to the secondary.
  - **Automatically updates DNS** so that applications reconnect to the new primary without needing manual changes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Failover Policies**

| Policy Type | Default Behavior                                                                     | Customization                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Automatic   | Enabled (failover happens automatically)                                             | Can be **disabled** for manual-only failover             |
| Read-Only   | Read-only listener is **disabled during failover** to reduce load on the new primary | You can configure it to **stay enabled** during failover |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Loss Considerations**

- Failover is asynchronous, so there is a chance of **data loss during unplanned failover.**
- Azure controls this using a setting called **`GracePeriodWithDataLossHours`**, which defines how long Azure will wait for the secondary to sync before failing over.

  - Default: **1 hour**
  - Set higher if your workload can‚Äôt afford much data loss.

## üîÑ **Difference from Active Geo-Replication**

| Feature                                   | Geo-Replication     | Auto-Failover Groups     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Automatic failover                        | No                  | Yes                      |
| Supports multiple databases in a group    | No                  | Yes                      |
| Connection string changes after failover? | Yes (manual update) | No (handled by listener) |
| SQL Managed Instance support              | No                  | Yes                      |
| Can replicate to the same region?         | Yes                 | No (only cross-region)   |
| Supports multiple secondary replicas      | Yes                 | No                       |
| Supports read-scale                       | Yes                 | Yes                      |

## üõ†Ô∏è **Setup Process Summary**

1. Create an **auto-failover group** in the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell.
2. Assign one or more databases to the failover group.
3. Azure automatically creates and seeds the secondary databases.
4. Configure your applications to connect via the failover group‚Äôs **listener name**.

## üåü **Benefits of Auto-Failover Groups**

- Fully managed HA/DR for Azure SQL Database and Managed Instance.
- **No need to update connection strings** after failover.
- Supports failover of multiple databases together.
- Simplifies DR configuration compared to traditional IaaS SQL Server.
