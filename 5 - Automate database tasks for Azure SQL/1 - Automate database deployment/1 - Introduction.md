### ✅ **Main Idea:**

In **on-premises environments**, deploying a database server requires **physical hardware setup** (racks, cabling, etc.).
In the **cloud**, like Azure, **infrastructure is virtualized and managed through APIs**, making deployments much faster and simpler.

---

### 🛠️ **Key Concept: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** means describing your cloud infrastructure (servers, databases, networks, etc.) in **code files**, rather than setting them up manually.
- These code files (scripts) are:

  - Stored in **source control** (e.g., GitHub).
  - Easily **reused** and **automated**.
  - Help maintain **consistency** across different environments (**Dev**, **Test**, **Prod**).
  - Reduce **human error** and **misconfigurations**.

### 📦 **Deployment Tools and Methods in Azure**

In this training, you'll learn to deploy Azure SQL resources using:

- **PowerShell** – a scripting language for automating Azure tasks.
- **Azure CLI (Command-Line Interface)** – cross-platform tool to interact with Azure services.
- **ARM Templates (Azure Resource Manager templates)** – JSON-based files that define Azure infrastructure.
- **Bicep** – a more readable, simplified language for writing ARM templates.

---

### 🎯 **Learning Outcomes:**

After this module, you’ll be able to:

- Explain the **deployment models** in Azure SQL.
- Deploy resources using **command-line tools** (PowerShell & Azure CLI).
- Use **ARM templates** and **Bicep** for repeatable deployments.
- Compare **different deployment options** and understand when to use each.

---

### 🔑 **Why It Matters:**

- Automating deployments allows you to **scale faster**, reduce manual effort, and maintain a **consistent, reliable infrastructure**.
- This is critical whether you’re managing a **single database** or a **large environment with multiple databases**.
