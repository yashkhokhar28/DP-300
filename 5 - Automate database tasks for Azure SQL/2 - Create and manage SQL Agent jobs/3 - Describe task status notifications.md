## üéØ **Key Concepts for Notifications**

| Object           | Purpose                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Operator**     | A person or group (e.g., DBA team) that receives notifications (typically via email). |
| **Notification** | Sends an alert when a job finishes, fails, or succeeds. Usually used for failures.    |
| **Alert**        | Detects specific errors or performance problems and notifies an operator.             |

## üë§ **Operators**

- An **Operator** is like a contact person or team who receives error or job notifications.
- Operators are configured with an **email address** (can be an individual or a distribution group).
- **Best practice:** Use an **email group** instead of a single person to avoid missed notifications when someone is out.

‚û°Ô∏è Example:
Create an operator called `DBATeam` with email `dba-support@yourcompany.com`.

---

## ‚úâÔ∏è **How to Enable Email Notifications**

- You must enable **Database Mail** in SQL Server and configure a **Mail Profile**.
- Then, enable this mail profile in **SQL Server Agent properties**.

---

## üîî **Notifications on Job Events**

- You can configure a SQL Server Agent job to notify an operator when the job:

  - **Fails** (most common)
  - **Succeeds**
  - **Completes** (success or fail)

‚öôÔ∏è Example use case:
Notify `DBATeam` if the nightly backup job **fails**, so they can fix the issue.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Alerts for Errors and Performance Problems**

**SQL Server Agent Alerts** notify you when specific events or conditions happen, such as:

- A particular SQL error number is logged (e.g., disk errors, deadlocks).
- A SQL Server error level ‚â• 16 occurs.
- A **performance condition** happens (e.g., CPU > 90% for 5 minutes).
- A **WMI event** happens (e.g., failover, storage issues).

‚û°Ô∏è Example Alerts:

| Alert Type            | Example                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| SQL Error Number      | Errors 823, 824, 825 (I/O errors indicating corruption) |
| Severity Level        | All errors of severity ‚â• 16                             |
| Performance Condition | Page Life Expectancy < 300 (indicating memory pressure) |
| WMI Event             | Availability Group failover                             |

## üîß **Response Actions for Alerts**

When an alert triggers, you can:

1. **Send an email notification** (most common).
2. **Run another SQL Agent job** to take action automatically.

   - Example: If storage errors are detected, run a job that performs `DBCC CHECKDB`.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **How to Create an Alert**

In SSMS:

1. Right-click **SQL Server Agent > New > Alert**.
2. Configure the **error number**, **severity level**, or **performance counter**.
3. Assign an **operator** to notify.
4. (Optional) Attach a SQL Agent job to automatically fix the problem.

## ‚úÖ **Summary**

| Topic                | Key Point                                                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Operators            | Contacts (people/groups) who get notifications                          |
| Notifications        | Triggered on job completion/failure/success                             |
| Alerts               | Triggered by error numbers, severity levels, or performance issues      |
| Notification methods | Typically via **Database Mail** using an email profile                  |
| Automated responses  | Can run another SQL Agent job instead of (or along with) notifications  |
| Typical use case     | Email the DBA team when a backup fails or CPU stays high for 5+ minutes |
