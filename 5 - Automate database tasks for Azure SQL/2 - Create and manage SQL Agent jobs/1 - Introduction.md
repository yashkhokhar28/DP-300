## ✅ **Why Are Scheduled Maintenance Tasks Needed?**

Databases require regular maintenance to:

- Keep them running efficiently.
- Ensure **data reliability and performance**.
- Automate repetitive administrative tasks.

### 🔧 **Examples of Common Maintenance Tasks:**

| Task Type             | Purpose                                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Backups               | Regularly save your database data                     |
| Update statistics     | Improve query performance by refreshing statistics    |
| Data loads (ETL jobs) | Extract, Transform, and Load data to a data warehouse |
| Index maintenance     | Rebuild or reorganize indexes                         |
| Cleanup jobs          | Delete old logs or data                               |

## ☁️ **SQL Server Agent in Azure SQL Managed Instance**

Azure SQL Managed Instance supports **most SQL Server Agent features**, so you can use it to automate your database tasks in the cloud.

### 🔍 **Minor differences from on-premises SQL Server:**

- Some **T-SQL commands or features** might work differently or have limitations.
- Example: Some system-level tasks (like OS-level scripts) are **restricted in Managed Instance**.

## 📊 **Built-in Monitoring & Alerts in Azure**

In addition to SQL Agent jobs, Azure provides:

- **Resource monitoring** (CPU, Memory, Storage).
- **Alerts & Notifications** when performance thresholds are breached.
- **Event handling** so you can trigger actions automatically when something happens.

## 🎯 **Learning Objectives of This Module:**

By the end of this topic, you’ll be able to:

1. Understand **essential database maintenance activities**.
2. **Set up notifications/alerts** for SQL Server Agent jobs (email alerts, failure alerts, etc.).
3. Create **alerts based on performance counters** (e.g., CPU > 90%, memory low).
