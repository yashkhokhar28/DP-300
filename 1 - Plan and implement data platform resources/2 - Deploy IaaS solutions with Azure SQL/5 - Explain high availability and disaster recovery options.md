### ‚úÖ **Summary: High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) Options for SQL Server on Azure VMs**

---

### üåê **Azure Platform High Availability Features**

| Feature                | Purpose                                         | Availability |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Availability Zones** | Spread VMs across separate data centers (zones) | \~99.99%     |
| **Availability Sets**  | Spread VMs across separate physical hosts/racks | \~99.95%     |

- **Availability Zones:** Best for fault tolerance across entire data centers in a region. Recommended when minimal cross-zone latency is acceptable.
- **Availability Sets:** Used within a single data center. Protects against server/rack failures when Availability Zones are unavailable.

---

### üîÑ **SQL Server High Availability Solutions**

#### 1. **Always On Availability Groups (AG)**

- Replicates databases across multiple SQL Server instances.
- Supports **up to 9 replicas**, **mix of synchronous and asynchronous** commits.
- Can span **Azure regions** or extend from **on-premises to Azure**.
- Protects **databases (not entire instances)**.
- Preferred for **modern deployments**.
- **Distributed Availability Groups** support cross-region disaster recovery.

#### Example Architecture:

- Primary in Zone 1
- Synchronous secondary in Zone 2
- Asynchronous secondary in another region for DR

---

#### 2. **SQL Server Failover Cluster Instances (FCI)**

- Provides **instance-level failover**.
- Requires **shared storage** (Azure shared file storage or Storage Spaces Direct).
- Best suited for **legacy workloads** migrating from on-premises.
- Doesn't provide DR without additional technologies.

### üö® **Disaster Recovery (DR) Options**

| DR Solution                       | Type                       | Key Benefit                                     |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **SQL Backups to Azure Blob**     | Database level backup      | Cost-effective, geo-redundant storage           |
| **Azure Backup for SQL Server**   | Agent-based backups        | Centralized management, long-term retention     |
| **Azure Site Recovery (ASR)**     | VM replication             | Full VM replication, block-level copy, failover |
| **Always On AG - async replicas** | Database level replication | Seamless failover to other regions              |

#### ‚úî **Azure Backup for SQL Server**

- Manages SQL backups automatically.
- Integrated with Azure Backup Vault.
- Protects against accidental deletion, provides retention and compliance.

#### ‚úî **Azure Site Recovery**

- Replicates the entire VM.
- Best for **infrastructure-level recovery**, not fine-tuned for databases.
- DR testing and failover automation supported.
- Higher **RPO/RTO** compared to AG and backups.

---

### üîë **Key Takeaways**

- **For High Availability:** Use **Availability Zones + Always On Availability Groups**.
- **For Disaster Recovery:** Combine **Always On AG (async) + Geo-redundant Backups**, optionally add **Azure Site Recovery** for VM-level failover.
- Plan your HADR based on workload latency sensitivity, licensing, and DR requirements.
