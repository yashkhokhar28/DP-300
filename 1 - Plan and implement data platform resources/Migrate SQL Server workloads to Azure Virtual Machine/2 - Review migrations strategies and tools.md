## ‚úÖ **Why Careful Migration Planning Is Important**

When migrating SQL Server to Azure VMs, you must plan for:

- **Why:** Understand the **benefits** you'll gain after migration (better performance, easy scaling, improved reliability).
- **How:** Choose the **right tools and methods** to move your data.

A key factor is deciding **how much downtime is acceptable**:

- Some businesses want **zero downtime**.
- Others are okay with **minutes or hours** of downtime.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Benefits of Running SQL Server on Azure VM**

- Full control over the **operating system** and **SQL Server instance**
- Can run advanced SQL features like:

  - SQL transactional replication
  - Always On Availability Groups
  - Integration/Analysis/Reporting Services
  - FileStream, PolyBase, etc.

- Support for **large databases (up to 256 TB)**
- Keep using your **on-premises SQL Server versions and editions**, no compatibility issues.
- Easier high availability, backups, and updates.

## üí∞ **Licensing Models**

Three main ways to license SQL Server on Azure VM:

| Model                                                | Description                                                 | When to Use                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pay-as-you-go (PAYG)                                 | SQL license **included in VM pricing**                      | Temporary/short-term workloads                                   |
| Bring Your Own License (BYOL) / Azure Hybrid Benefit | Use your **existing SQL licenses**, pay only for VM         | For customers with **Enterprise Agreement & Software Assurance** |
| HA/DR License Model                                  | Free SQL license for passive **disaster recovery replicas** | Disaster recovery setups                                         |

---

## üåê **Networking Options**

When you deploy a SQL Server VM, you set the **SQL connectivity type**:

- **Public:** Accessible over the internet (configures firewall and authentication for you).
- **Private:** Accessible only from within your virtual network (more secure).
- **Local:** Accessible only from the same VM (for local use).

---

## üîë **Key Management**

Azure Key Vault (AKV) helps store and manage your encryption keys securely.

- SQL Server can integrate with AKV for managing **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)** keys.
- Makes your environment **more secure and compliant**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **VM Sizing & Performance Optimization**

To ensure good performance:

| Resource         | Recommendation                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| VM Size          | Enterprise: DS3_v2+, Standard/Web: DS2_v2+                                                  |
| Storage          | Use **Premium SSDs** for production                                                         |
| Disks            | Separate disks for data, log, and TempDB; use at least 2 P30 disks                          |
| Disk Caching     | Enable read caching for data/TempDB disks, no caching for logs                              |
| IOPS             | Use Ultra SSD or disk striping for high I/O workloads                                       |
| I/O & SQL Config | Enable page compression, disable autoshrink, tune autogrowth, move system DBs to data disks |
