## ‚úÖ **What is SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machine (VM)?**

**SQL Server on Azure VM** is an **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** offering.
It lets you run **full SQL Server editions** on a virtual machine in Azure‚Äîjust like running SQL Server on your on-premises servers, but without managing physical hardware.

- You **fully control** the operating system, SQL Server version, and any other software you want to install.
- Microsoft provides **pre-built VM images** that already have SQL Server installed with your chosen version and edition.

## üîë **When to Use SQL Server on Azure VM (Instead of Managed Services)?**

Choose SQL Server on Azure VM when you:

| Scenario                                                       | Reason                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Need OS-level access                                           | To install other software, custom monitoring, backup agents, or scripts                                                                                    |
| Use advanced SQL features                                      | Like **FILESTREAM**, **FileTable**, **PolyBase**, **cross-instance transactions** ‚Äî which are **not yet supported in Azure SQL Database/Managed Instance** |
| Want full SQL version control                                  | Stay on a specific SQL Server version (ex: SQL Server 2016 SP3)                                                                                            |
| Run smaller workloads                                          | Where managed services like Azure SQL Managed Instance may feel oversized or too expensive                                                                 |
| Have existing **non-database apps** running on the same server | You want to migrate them **as-is**                                                                                                                         |

## üí° **Example Business Case (Scenario):**

- You‚Äôre a **Senior Database Administrator** at a global **retail company**.
- Your company runs **many SQL Server versions across multiple on-premises servers**, supporting apps like:

  - CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
  - Stock & Inventory Management
  - HR Systems
  - Distribution/Logistics

- The company wants to **modernize its data platform** by moving to Azure.

Your role is to:

- Assess the **current environment**.
- Plan **which workloads** should move to Azure VMs.
- Execute the **migration to Azure VMs**, choosing the right strategy (online vs offline).
- Perform **post-migration checks** to ensure performance and functionality.

## üîÑ **What You'll Learn in This Module:**

1. **Migration strategies:** Online vs Offline.
2. **Tools:** Azure Migrate, Database Migration Service, Backup/Restore, etc.
3. **Post-migration steps:** Verify performance, run validation tests, optimize workloads.

---

## üîç **Summary:**

‚û° SQL Server on Azure VM is perfect for companies that **need full SQL Server features** and **OS-level control**, but want to get rid of physical servers.
‚û° This is **not a managed service like Azure SQL Database or SQL Managed Instance**‚Äîyou still manage the SQL Server software, patches, and OS configurations yourself.
‚û° It gives you the **most compatibility** for lifting-and-shifting existing workloads to Azure.
