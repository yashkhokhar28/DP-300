## âœ… **Summary of SQL Server Migration Strategy to Azure**

---

### **ðŸ“Œ Overall Goal:**

Modernize and standardize your companyâ€™s **SQL Server data estate** by migrating from multiple on-premises environments to Azure-based solutions for better scalability, cost savings, and modernization.

---

### **ðŸš€ 1. Understand Data Platform Modernization**

- Data modernization means updating your database technologies to support business goals, improve performance, and enable cloud capabilities.
- It often involves moving databases to Azure SQL services.
- Azure provides **scalability, cost efficiency, security, and managed services** for SQL workloads.

### **ðŸ›  2. Follow the 5 Stages of Modernization**

| Stage                            | Purpose                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Discovery**                    | Identify existing databases, dependencies, workloads, and environment details.             |
| **Assessment**                   | Analyze workloads for compatibility issues, blockers, and select the right Azure services. |
| **Planning**                     | Choose the right migration approach (IaaS, PaaS), create schedules, and plan mitigation.   |
| **Transform & Optimize**         | Make code/schema changes to support the target platform and optimize performance.          |
| **Migrate, Validate, Remediate** | Execute the migration, test results, and fix any post-migration issues.                    |

### **ðŸ”‘ 3. Select the Right Azure SQL Technology**

Depending on your workloads:

| Target Platform                   | When to Use                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SQL Server on Azure VM (IaaS)** | Minimal changes, full control over OS and SQL features.              |
| **Azure SQL Managed Instance**    | Instance-level features needed, minimal migration changes.           |
| **Azure SQL Database**            | Modern apps, simpler workloads, no need for instance-level features. |
| **Azure Synapse Analytics**       | Enterprise-scale data warehouses with big data analytics.            |
