# üß† Azure SQL Database Migration ‚Äì Full Summary with Real-World Context

## üî∑ What Is Azure SQL Database?

Azure SQL Database is a **cloud-based service** (Platform as a Service ‚Äì PaaS) from Microsoft. Unlike traditional SQL Server, **you don‚Äôt manage the OS, backups, or hardware** ‚Äî Azure does all that for you.

### üéØ Real-World Example:

Imagine you run a **bike manufacturing company** with databases for products, inventory, and HR. Instead of maintaining physical servers, you move them to Azure SQL ‚Äî reducing effort, cost, and getting better reliability.

## ‚úÖ When to Use Azure SQL Database (Instead of Managed Instance)

| Scenario                                | Why Azure SQL is Better                                |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Unpredictable workloads                 | It auto-scales resources, saving money.                |
| New apps with unknown performance needs | Start small and grow later.                            |
| Simpler setup preferred                 | Easier for small teams.                                |
| Need lots of storage per database       | Azure SQL supports more storage than Managed Instance. |

## üö¶ Migration Process Overview

1. **Assess** your databases (use DMA tool).
2. **Create** Azure SQL Database.
3. Choose **online** (no downtime) or **offline** (with downtime) migration.
4. **Migrate** using tools like DMA or Azure DMS.
5. **Optimize** your database post-migration.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Why Assessment Is Crucial

Before migration, **run an assessment** to:

- Find out what won‚Äôt work in Azure SQL.
- Discover performance improvements you can gain.

üìå Tool: Use **Data Migration Assistant (DMA)** for this.

## üîÅ Migration Tools & Modes

| Tool                           | Type    |
| ------------------------------ | ------- |
| Azure DMS                      | Offline |
| Transactional Replication      | Online  |
| Azure Migrate                  | Offline |
| Import/Export Wizard / BACPAC  | Offline |
| Bulk Copy (`bcp`)              | Offline |
| Azure Data Factory             | Offline |
| DMA (Data Migration Assistant) | Offline |

üìå **Tip**: Use **Azure DMS** for large, complex migrations.

---

## üöÄ Performance Tips During Migration

- Fix I/O bottlenecks before migration.
- Use high-tier DB during migration (e.g., Hyperscale).
- Disable auto-stat updates temporarily.
- Scale down post-migration to save money.
- Place files near the target region.
- Retry failed connections using **exponential backoff** (e.g., 5s ‚Üí 10s ‚Üí 20s‚Ä¶).

---

## üß™ Retry Logic in Action

If a SELECT query fails:

1. Wait 5 seconds.
2. Try again.
3. Increase wait time if needed.
4. Always retry using a new connection.

---

## üß† Real Example: Weekend HR DB Migration

A bike company migrates its **HR database** over the weekend using **offline migration**, minimizing disruption and saving costs.

---

## üß∞ Azure SQL Migration Extension (for Azure Data Studio)

This free tool helps:

- Assess databases
- Recommend best Azure options
- Migrate small/medium databases
- Use Azure DMS in the background

### Migration Steps:

1. Install Azure Data Studio + extension.
2. Select databases and run assessment.
3. Connect to Azure SQL.
4. Create/select Azure DMS.
5. Configure data source and schema.
6. Start migration (skips empty tables to save time).

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Table names with **double-byte characters** (like some non-English names) must be renamed before migrating.

---

## üìä Migration Progress Monitoring

You can monitor from:

- **Azure Data Studio** ‚Üí Migration dashboard
- **Azure Portal** ‚Üí Monitor DMS progress

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Scale with PowerShell / Azure CLI

You can use scripts to automate bulk migrations.
Example:

```powershell
New-AzDataMigrationToSqlDb -TargetDbName AdventureWorks
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è What is Data Migration Assistant (DMA)?

A free tool to:

- Check for compatibility issues.
- Generate migration scripts.
- Move schema and data (good for small/medium databases).

### Types of Migrations in DMA:

| Type          | Description                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Schema + Data | Structure + data                      |
| Schema only   | Only tables/views/procedures          |
| Data only     | Only data (schema must already exist) |

---

## üìã Step-by-Step with DMA

1. Run assessment ‚Üí fix issues.
2. Create project ‚Üí connect to source SQL Server.
3. Choose objects ‚Üí tables, views, etc.
4. Deploy schema to Azure.
5. Migrate data.
6. Monitor progress.

üîß Optional: Tune config via `dma.exe.config` (e.g., parallel DBs, timeouts).

---

## ‚úÖ DMA Best Practices

- Don‚Äôt run DMA on your production server.
- Use a shared folder for temporary files.
- Enable encryption.
- Fix constraints before migration.

---

## üì¶ What‚Äôs a BACPAC File?

A compressed `.bacpac` archive of:

- Schema (structure)
- Data (rows)

Best for **offline, one-time migrations**.

---

### How to Use BACPAC

1. Export `.bacpac` from SSMS or SqlPackage.
2. Upload to Azure Blob or local storage.
3. Import via Azure Portal or SqlPackage.

Example command:

```bash
SqlPackage.exe /a:import /sf:AdventureWorks.bacpac
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è BACPAC Limitations

- Only works offline (requires downtime).
- Doesn‚Äôt include logins, jobs, linked servers.
- Not ideal for databases >200 GB.

---

## üîÅ Transactional Replication (For Online Migrations)

Used when apps **must stay live**.

### How It Works:

1. Snapshot initial data.
2. Sync changes using SQL Server logs.
3. Push changes to Azure in real time.

üìå Azure supports **Push subscriptions** only.

---

### Key Components:

| Term         | Role                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Publisher    | Source SQL Server               |
| Subscriber   | Azure SQL Database              |
| Distributor  | Coordinates replication         |
| Article      | Table/view being replicated     |
| Publication  | A group of articles             |
| Subscription | Request for data from Azure SQL |

---

### Setup Steps

1. Configure distributor (`sp_adddistributor`)
2. Enable publisher (`sp_addpublication`)
3. Add tables (`sp_addarticle`)
4. Create subscription (`sp_addsubscription`)
5. Push data (`sp_addpushsubscription_agent`)

‚úÖ Monitor using SQL Server Management Studio (not Azure Portal).

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Replication Limitations

- Only **Transactional Replication** is supported (no merge, no peer-to-peer).
- Schema changes during replication are limited.
- SQL Agent jobs must be managed manually.

---

## üéØ When to Use Replication?

| Use Case                           | Replication Fit        |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 24/7 critical system               | ‚úÖ Yes                 |
| One-time migration (with downtime) | ‚ùå No (use DMS/BACPAC) |

---

## üì¶ Partial Data Migration ‚Äì Why and How?

### Why Migrate Partially?

- Keep **sensitive data** on-premises.
- Move only **active or useful data**.
- Save on **cloud storage costs**.

### Example:

The bike company migrates only **products & customers** to Azure, while keeping **sales data** on-premises.

---

### Tools for Partial Migration

#### 1. `bcp` Utility

Simple tool to copy data one table at a time.

Example:

```bash
bcp AdventureWorks.dbo.Product out product_data.txt
```

‚úÖ Fast, scriptable
‚ö†Ô∏è Schema must exist beforehand.

#### 2. Azure Data Factory (ADF)

Cloud-based tool for advanced, scheduled migrations.

‚úÖ Graphical interface, filter data, automate jobs
‚ö†Ô∏è Requires setup + integration runtime for on-prem access.

---

## üß≠ Which Tool to Use?

| Situation                     | Best Tool                                |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Quick table copy              | `bcp`                                    |
| Scheduled/filtered migrations | Azure Data Factory                       |
| Full schema + data migration  | Azure Migration Extension / DMA / BACPAC |

---

## üéØ Final Summary

Azure SQL Database gives you:

- **PaaS convenience** (no server mgmt)
- **Elastic scale**
- **Built-in security, backups, HA**
- **Multiple migration paths** (DMA, DMS, BACPAC, replication)

Choose tools based on:

- **Downtime allowance**
- **Database size**
- **Data sensitivity**
- **Complexity of schema**
