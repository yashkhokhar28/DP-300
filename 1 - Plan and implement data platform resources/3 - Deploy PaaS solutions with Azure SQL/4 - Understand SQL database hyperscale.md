## ‚úÖ **What is Hyperscale in Azure SQL Database?**

Hyperscale is a **highly scalable service tier** in Azure SQL Database that removes many of the size and performance limits of traditional cloud databases.

- **Old Limit:** Before Hyperscale, a single Azure SQL Database could store **up to 4 TB**.
- **With Hyperscale:** You can scale **beyond 100 TB**, with **no hard maximum limit**.

It's designed for **large databases**, heavy workloads, and businesses needing **rapid growth, fast backups, and quick scaling.**

## üîë **Key Features of Hyperscale**

### 1. **Independent Scaling of Compute and Storage:**

- You can **scale up or down** CPU and memory **independently** of the data storage.
- Add **more compute replicas** to handle heavy read workloads.

### 2. **Architecture:**

- Compute (query processing) and storage are **separated**.
- Storage grows **automatically as data grows**, without downtime.
- Multiple compute nodes (**replicas**) can be added for scaling **read workloads**.

### 3. **Rapid Backup and Restore:**

- Backups and restores happen **within minutes**, regardless of database size.
- Backups are stored in **Azure Blob storage** using file snapshots.

### 4. **Read Scale-out:**

- You can create **read-only replicas** for reporting or analytics.
- Connection strings can be configured to route reads to these replicas using:

  ```plaintext
  ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly
  ```

## üîí **Security Features:**

Hyperscale supports **all security features of Azure SQL Database**, including:

- **Firewall rules:** Control access by IP address or Virtual Network.
- **Authentication:** SQL Authentication, Microsoft Entra (Azure AD), Windows Authentication.
- **Data Security:**

  - Transparent Data Encryption (at rest)
  - TLS encryption (in transit)
  - Always Encrypted (in use)
  - Row-Level Security (RLS)
  - Dynamic Data Masking
  - Integration with Azure Key Vault for key management

- **Auditing & Threat Detection:** Detects unusual activities like SQL Injection, suspicious logins, and privilege escalation.

## üöÄ **Performance Advantages:**

| Capability                | Traditional SQL DB | Hyperscale SQL DB |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Max Database Size         | 4 TB               | 100+ TB           |
| Backup/Restore Time       | Hours              | Minutes           |
| Scaling compute resources | Slow & limited     | Fast & dynamic    |
| Read replicas             | Limited            | Multiple replicas |
| Transaction performance   | Standard           | Higher throughput |

## ‚öôÔ∏è **How to Deploy Hyperscale in Azure Portal:**

1. Go to **Azure SQL Database** creation.
2. Under **Compute + storage**, click **Configure database**.
3. Select **Service Tier = Hyperscale**.
4. Choose compute size (vCores), storage, and backup settings.
5. Click **Create**.

## üõë **Important Considerations:**

- Once upgraded to Hyperscale, **you can‚Äôt downgrade to a lower tier**.
- Pricing is slightly higher due to additional storage costs per terabyte.

---

### ‚û§ **Use Cases:**

- Large-scale **transactional systems**.
- Data warehouses or heavy **reporting workloads**.
- Modernizing large on-premises SQL Server databases.
- Applications with unpredictable or growing workloads.
