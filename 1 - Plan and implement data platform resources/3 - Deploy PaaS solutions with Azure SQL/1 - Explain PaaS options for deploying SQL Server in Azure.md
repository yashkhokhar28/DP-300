## ‚úÖ **Azure SQL as a PaaS Offering**

**Platform as a Service (PaaS):**

- Microsoft manages **infrastructure**, **OS**, and **SQL Server updates**.
- You only manage your **databases** and **data**.
- Ideal for reducing administration work and improving scalability.

Azure SQL PaaS offerings include:

- **Azure SQL Database** (single database or elastic pool)
- **Azure SQL Managed Instance** (for easier migration from on-premises SQL Server)

---

## üîç **Deployment Models in Azure SQL Database**

### 1. **Single Database**

- Each database runs independently.
- Great for isolated workloads with predictable performance.
- Billing and scaling are done **per database**.

### 2. **Elastic Pool**

- Group of databases sharing resources.
- Ideal when databases have **variable workloads** that don‚Äôt peak at the same time.
- Cost-effective for SaaS applications.

---

## üí≥ **Purchasing Models**

### A. **DTU (Database Transaction Unit) Model**

- Combines CPU, memory, and I/O into a single performance unit.
- Service tiers: Basic, Standard, Premium.
- **Simple but less flexible** for fine-tuning resources.

### B. **vCore Model** _(Recommended)_

- You choose the number of vCores, memory, and storage.
- More control and **better aligned with on-prem SQL Server licensing** (Azure Hybrid Benefit).
- Three service tiers:

| Tier                  | Best for          | Storage         | Resilience          | Max DB Size |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| **General Purpose**   | Regular workloads | Premium Storage | Moderate            | 4 TB        |
| **Business Critical** | High performance  | Local SSD       | High (read replica) | 4 TB        |
| **Hyperscale**        | Huge DBs          | Premium Storage | High                | 100 TB      |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Serverless Compute Option (Only in General Purpose Tier)**

- Scales compute **automatically** based on workload.
- **Pauses when idle**, so you only pay for storage when inactive.
- Useful for databases with unpredictable or sporadic workloads.
- Limitations: doesn't support geo-replication, long-term retention, some background jobs.

---

## üîí **Backups**

- Fully **automated backups**:

  - Full backup: weekly
  - Differential backup: every 12 hours
  - Log backups: every 5‚Äì10 minutes

- Retention: **7 to 35 days**, can be extended to **10 years** with Long-Term Retention (LTR).
- Restore options:

  - Restore to **a new database** only (can't overwrite existing databases).
  - Use **Azure Portal, PowerShell, or CLI**.

---

## üåç **High Availability and Disaster Recovery**

### **Active Geo-Replication**

- Creates up to **4 secondary read replicas** in different regions.
- Great for **read scaling** and disaster recovery.
- Failover is **manual or application-driven**, requires changing connection strings.

### **Auto-Failover Groups**

- Builds on geo-replication.
- Provides a **single connection endpoint**.
- Failover is **automatic** and seamless for your app (no connection string change needed).

---

## ‚úîÔ∏è **Summary**

Azure SQL PaaS (Database & Managed Instance) lets you:

- Focus on your data and apps, while Microsoft handles backups, patching, and infrastructure.
- Choose how much control you want over compute and storage (vCore vs. DTU).
- Easily scale up/down or pause databases when needed.
- Improve availability and disaster recovery with geo-replication and failover groups.
