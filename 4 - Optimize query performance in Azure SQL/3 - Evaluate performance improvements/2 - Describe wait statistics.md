## üîç **What Are Wait Statistics?**

In SQL Server, when a query runs, it sometimes has to **wait** for resources to be available (e.g., CPU, memory, disk, locks). SQL Server tracks these waits **to help identify performance problems**.

Each wait type describes **why a query is waiting**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Types of Waits:**

| Wait Type          | Meaning                                              | Example                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Resource waits** | Waiting for a SQL resource (lock, memory, I/O, etc.) | Waiting to read data from disk       |
| **Queue waits**    | Worker is waiting for work to be assigned            | Background cleanup waiting for tasks |
| **External waits** | Waiting for something outside SQL Server             | Waiting for a linked server response |

## üìä **Where Do You See Waits?**

Use these Dynamic Management Views (**DMVs**) in SQL Server:

- `sys.dm_os_wait_stats`: Waits since server startup.
- `sys.dm_db_wait_stats`: Azure SQL Database equivalent.
- `sys.dm_exec_session_wait_stats`: Shows waits by active session.

Example query:

```sql
SELECT TOP 10 wait_type, wait_time_ms, waiting_tasks_count
FROM sys.dm_os_wait_stats
ORDER BY wait_time_ms DESC;
```

This shows the top 10 wait types on your SQL Server instance by total wait time.

## üõë **Examples of Common Wait Types:**

### 1. **RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE**

- **Meaning:** Waiting for memory.
- **Problem:** Query needs memory but it's all used up.
- **Fix:** Tune queries to use less memory, fix bad query plans, add RAM if needed.

---

### 2. **LCK_M_X**

- **Meaning:** Waiting for a lock (exclusive lock).
- **Problem:** A blocking issue. One query is holding a lock; others must wait.
- **Fix:** Optimize transactions, reduce transaction time, use **Read Committed Snapshot Isolation (RCSI)**.

---

### 3. **PAGEIOLATCH_SH**

- **Meaning:** Waiting to read a data page from disk.
- **Problem:** Could be slow storage or missing indexes causing table scans.
- **Fix:** Add helpful indexes or improve storage performance.

---

### 4. **SOS_SCHEDULER_YIELD**

- **Meaning:** Waiting to be scheduled on the CPU.
- **Problem:** High CPU utilization.
- **Fix:** Tune expensive queries, improve indexes, or scale up CPU.

---

### 5. **CXPACKET**

- **Meaning:** Waiting for parallel query threads to finish.
- **Problem:** Parallel queries inefficiently using CPU.
- **Fix:** Set **MAXDOP** to limit parallelism; increase the **cost threshold for parallelism**.

Example command to limit parallelism:

```sql
EXEC sp_configure 'max degree of parallelism', 4;
RECONFIGURE;
```

---

### 6. **PAGEIOLATCH_UP (on TempDB)**

- **Meaning:** TempDB contention on data pages.
- **Problem:** Multiple queries competing for the same TempDB pages.
- **Fix:** Use **multiple TempDB files** (1 file per CPU core, up to 8). Example:

  - If you have 4 cores, create 4 TempDB data files of equal size.

---

## ‚úÖ **How to Use Wait Statistics Effectively**

1. **Look for the top wait types.**

   - Example: If **PAGEIOLATCH_SH** is high, maybe storage is slow.

2. **Check the average wait time:**

   ```sql
   SELECT wait_type, wait_time_ms/waiting_tasks_count AS avg_wait_ms
   FROM sys.dm_os_wait_stats
   WHERE waiting_tasks_count > 0;
   ```

3. **Compare wait stats over time.**

   - Clear the waits:

   ```sql
   DBCC SQLPERF('sys.dm_os_wait_stats', CLEAR);
   ```

   - Then, monitor what new waits appear.

4. **Use the Query Store** to find which query caused waits.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Example Scenario**

### Problem:

- Queries suddenly slow down.
- You check `sys.dm_os_wait_stats` and see:

  - **RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE** high ‚Üí queries waiting for memory.

### Action:

- Investigate large queries.
- Tune those queries to return fewer rows.
- Add missing indexes.
- Increase server memory if required.

---

## ‚úîÔ∏è **Summary of Wait Statistics Use**

- They **show where SQL Server is spending time waiting**, not executing.
- Analyzing waits tells you if your issue is **CPU, disk, memory, locks, or external systems**.
- Helps you tune the database **for better overall performance**.
