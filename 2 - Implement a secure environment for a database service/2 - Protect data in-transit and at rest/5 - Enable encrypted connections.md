## 🔐 **What Does It Mean to Encrypt a SQL Connection?**

When your application connects to SQL Server, data like usernames, passwords, and query results **travel over the network**. Without encryption, attackers could intercept this data.

With **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**:

- The data is **encrypted while traveling** between your app and SQL Server.
- No one can read the data even if they intercept the network traffic.

This protects your sensitive data **“in-transit”**.

## ⚙️ **How Does SQL Server Encrypt Connections?**

SQL Server uses **TLS certificates** to secure connections.

To enable this:

1. You need to **install a TLS certificate** on the SQL Server.
2. SQL Server uses this certificate to encrypt and decrypt the connection traffic.

## 📜 **Certificate Requirements**

Your certificate:

- Must be in the **local machine or current user certificate store**.
- Must be **valid (not expired)**.
- Must be accessible by the **SQL Server service account**.

⚠️ If SQL Server can’t access the certificate properly, it will **fail to start** after configuration.

## 🛠️ **Steps to Enable Encrypted Connections in SQL Server**

### 1. Open SQL Server Configuration Manager

Run it as **Administrator**.

### 2. Configure the Protocol

- Go to: **SQL Server Network Configuration → Protocols for \<your-instance> → Properties**.
- In the **Certificate tab**, select your installed certificate.
- On the **Flags tab**, set **ForceEncryption = Yes**.
- Click OK.

### 3. Restart SQL Server

For changes to apply.

## ✅ **Test Encrypted Connection from SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**

- Open SSMS → **Connect to Server**.
- Click **Options → Connection Properties tab**.
- Check the box: **“Encrypt connection”**.
- Click **Connect**.

If configured correctly, the connection is now encrypted.

## ☁️ **Azure SQL Database**

Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance **use TLS encryption by default**. You only need to make sure your application:

- Has encryption **enabled in the connection string**.
- Trusts the server certificate (or uses a trusted certificate authority).

Example connection string option:

```
Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;
```
