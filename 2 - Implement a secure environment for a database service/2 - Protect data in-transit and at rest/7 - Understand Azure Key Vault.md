## üîê **What is Azure Key Vault?**

Azure Key Vault is a **secure cloud service** for storing and managing **secrets**, such as:

- Passwords
- Encryption keys
- Certificates
- API keys

It provides a **centralized, secure way** to store and control access to sensitive data for applications and services.

## üîç **Why Use Key Vault?**

| Benefit                        | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Centralized secret management  | Manage all your application secrets in one place                                         |
| Strong access controls         | Uses its own **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** separate from Azure subscription roles |
| Secure storage                 | Secrets are protected using **HSM-backed encryption**                                    |
| Simplifies encryption features | Works seamlessly with Azure services like SQL Server for encryption                      |
| Auditing and monitoring        | Track who accessed or modified secrets                                                   |

## üîë **SQL Server Integration with Azure Key Vault**

### What can SQL Server store in Key Vault?

- **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) certificates** (encrypts your database files)
- **Backup encryption certificates**
- **Always Encrypted column master keys** (protects specific data columns)

This works for:

- SQL Server running **on Azure Virtual Machines**
- SQL Server running **on-premises** (more complex setup)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **How to Set Up Azure Key Vault for SQL Server**

### 1. **Key Vault Setup**

- Create a **Key Vault** in Azure.
- Add an **application registration** (App ID & secret).
- Assign the app **Key Vault access policies** (read/write keys).

### 2. **Configure SQL Server Credentials**

On SQL Server (inside the Azure VM):

- Create a **login** (for example, `sql_keyvault_user`).
- Create a **credential** with:

  - Identity: The **Key Vault name**.
  - Secret: The **App ID (Client ID)** and **App Secret**.

Example:

```sql
CREATE CREDENTIAL [https://mykeyvault.vault.azure.net/]
WITH IDENTITY = 'AppClientID',
SECRET = 'AppClientSecret';
```

### 3. **Create an Asymmetric Key**

- First, create the key in Azure Key Vault.
- Then, in SQL Server:

```sql
CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY MyKey
FROM PROVIDER [AzureKeyVault_Provider]
WITH PROVIDER_KEY_NAME = 'MyAzureKey';
```

Now, SQL Server can use this key for:

- Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
- Backup encryption
- Always Encrypted column encryption

## üõ°Ô∏è **Key Point About Security**

Even if someone is an Azure **Subscription Admin**, they **won‚Äôt have access to Key Vault** unless given permission. This isolates database security from general Azure admin roles.

## üîó **When is This Useful?**

| Scenario                                | Why it Helps                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Securing sensitive data in the cloud    | Prevents unauthorized access to encryption keys       |
| Enabling compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) | Centralized, auditable key management                 |
| Automating secure database deployments  | Keys and certificates provisioned at VM creation time |
| Protecting on-prem SQL Server           | Can also configure, but setup is more manual          |
