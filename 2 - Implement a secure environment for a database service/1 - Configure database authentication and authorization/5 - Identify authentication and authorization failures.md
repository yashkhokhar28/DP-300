## ✅ **Common Causes of Connection Failures**

1. **Reconfiguration events:**

   - Azure dynamically reallocates or updates its infrastructure. During this, a database might restart, briefly breaking connections.
   - These are usually **short (less than 60 seconds).**

2. **Firewall issues:**

   - Firewall rules might block the connection.

3. **Login problems:**

   - Incorrect username or password.
   - Login is disabled.
   - Login doesn’t exist.

4. **Database/server resource limits exceeded:**

   - CPU, storage, or memory limits might stop the database from processing new connections.

5. **Timeouts:**

   - Slow networks or long-running queries may cause timeouts.

## ✅ **Transient Faults (Temporary Errors)**

**Transient faults** are **temporary connection failures** caused by short-term issues in Azure’s environment. They often **resolve on their own.**

Example transient errors:

| Error message                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Can't open database requested by login. The login failed.       |
| Can't process request. Not enough resources to process request. |
| Too many operations in progress for subscription.               |

➡️ These typically happen during:

- Planned maintenance
- Automatic scaling or failover
- Unplanned interruptions (rare)

Azure reconfigures your database and reconnects within \~60 seconds.

## ✅ **How to Monitor Transient Errors**

| Issue                               | Recommended Action                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Login failures                      | Check Azure Service Health for outages.                                 |
| Resource limits                     | Monitor CPU, memory, and storage for your database. Scale up if needed. |
| Long authentication failures (>60s) | Contact Microsoft Azure Support.                                        |

## ✅ **Retry Logic in Applications**

Apps should **automatically retry** after transient errors instead of showing failures to users.

Microsoft recommends:

- **Wait 5 seconds before the first retry.**
- **Use exponential backoff:** Increase the wait time with each retry (e.g., 5s, 10s, 20s… up to 60s).
- **Set a maximum retry limit** to avoid infinite loops.

⚠️ **Important:**
If a **SELECT query fails**, close the current connection and **retry with a new connection.** Don’t retry the same connection.

## ✅ **Troubleshooting Login Failures**

If you see:
`Login failed for user '<User name>'`

✔️ Check the following:

1. **Is the login disabled?**
   Run:

   ```sql
   SELECT name, is_disabled FROM sys.sql_logins WHERE name = '<User name>';
   ```

   Enable it with:

   ```sql
   ALTER LOGIN <User name> ENABLE;
   ```

2. **Does the login exist?**
   If not, create it:

   ```sql
   CREATE LOGIN <User name> WITH PASSWORD = 'StrongPassword';
   ```

3. **Create the user in the target database:**

   ```sql
   CREATE USER <User name> FOR LOGIN <User name>;
   ```

4. **Grant access by adding the user to a role or granting permissions:**

   ```sql
   ALTER ROLE db_datareader ADD MEMBER <User name>;
   ```

   or

   ```sql
   GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA::Sales TO <User name>;
   ```

## ✅ **Check the Connection String**

If you recently:

- Created a new database,
- Changed the server name, or
- Rotated credentials,

✔️ Update the **connection string** in your app.

From Azure Portal:

1. Go to **SQL Databases** → Select your database.
2. Open the **Connection strings** section.
3. Copy and update the connection string in your app.

   - Add your username and password.
   - Update the server name if needed.

## ✅ **Key Takeaways**

| Issue                   | What to Do                                                           |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transient failures      | Retry with exponential backoff. Don’t panic — these resolve quickly. |
| Login failed            | Check if the login exists, is enabled, and has correct permissions.  |
| Firewall/config errors  | Validate server and database firewall settings.                      |
| Resource exhaustion     | Monitor and scale up compute/storage as needed.                      |
| Repeated failures > 60s | Contact Azure support.                                               |
