### üîç **Key Topics Covered**

| Topic                                     | What It Means                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data Classification**                   | Label and tag sensitive data (e.g., Personal Info, Financial Data). Helps in identifying and protecting sensitive columns in your database.                        |
| **Server & Database Auditing**            | Tracks and logs all database activities like login attempts, query execution, and data access. Essential for compliance reporting.                                 |
| **Row-Level Security (RLS)**              | Restricts data access at the **row level**, so users only see rows they are authorized to see.                                                                     |
| **Dynamic Data Masking (DDM)**            | Masks sensitive data when queried, without modifying the data itself (e.g., shows only part of a phone number).                                                    |
| **Microsoft Defender for SQL**            | Provides **threat detection**, vulnerability assessments, and advanced security recommendations for SQL databases.                                                 |
| **Ledger**                                | A blockchain-based feature in Azure SQL that allows you to create an immutable (unchangeable) record of your data changes. Ensures data hasn‚Äôt been tampered with. |
| **Azure Purview (now Microsoft Purview)** | A data governance solution that helps you **discover, classify, and manage data** across your entire organization, including Azure SQL databases.                  |
