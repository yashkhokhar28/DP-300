### ‚úÖ **Microsoft Purview: Explained**

---

### üîç **What is Microsoft Purview?**

Microsoft Purview is a **data governance** and **data management tool** that helps you:

- Discover your data across **on-premises**, **multi-cloud**, and **SaaS platforms**
- **Classify sensitive data**
- Track **data lineage** (where data comes from and where it flows)
- Build a **central catalog** where your teams can **find, govern, and secure** data across your organization.

‚û°Ô∏è It simplifies managing **data security, compliance, and usage** across your entire data estate.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Core Features of Microsoft Purview**

| **Feature**                         | **What It Does**                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data discovery & classification** | Scans your data sources, identifies sensitive data, and classifies it automatically. |
| **Unified data map**                | Provides a **holistic view** of all your data assets and where they are located.     |
| **Data catalog**                    | Allows users to search and find data by business terms or technical attributes.      |
| **Data lineage tracking**           | Shows **how data flows** from source to destination, including transformations.      |
| **Access & governance controls**    | Manages who can access data and tracks access activity.                              |
| **Integrates with Microsoft tools** | Works with **Azure SQL Database, Power BI, Microsoft 365**, and many others.         |

### ‚öôÔ∏è **How Does It Work?**

- You **register your data sources** (e.g., Azure SQL Database).
- Purview **scans** these sources and **extracts metadata**, such as:

  - Table names
  - Column types
  - Sensitive data (e.g., emails, credit card numbers)
  - Data flows between systems (**lineage**)

- The results are shown in a **central governance portal**, where:

  - Data stewards govern access.
  - Data scientists and analysts search and use the data.
  - Security teams track sensitive data.

---

### üìä **Example: Using Purview with Azure SQL Database**

#### ‚úîÔ∏è **Capabilities for SQL Database:**

- Automatically scans the database for:

  - Sensitive columns (like SSNs, credit card numbers)
  - Data lineage through stored procedures and pipelines

- Helps understand **who owns the data**, where it came from, and who accesses it.

#### ‚úîÔ∏è **Search & Discovery:**

- Lets users search for "customer email" and see which databases, columns, and tables contain email addresses.
- No need to manually document the data in spreadsheets.

#### ‚úîÔ∏è **Data Insights:**

- See reports like:

  - % of your databases that are scanned
  - Which tables contain sensitive data
  - What portion of your estate is missing documentation

### üîë **Security Considerations**

| **Area**               | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Firewall**           | Allow Purview to access your database either by: <br> - Allowing Azure services <br> - Using a **self-hosted integration runtime** <br> - Using a **Managed Virtual Network** |
| **Authentication**     | Use **Managed Identity** (recommended), **Service Principal**, or **SQL Authentication** to scan your Azure SQL database.                                                     |
| **Permissions Needed** | - Reader access on the data source <br> - Ability to query tables for scanning                                                                                                |

### üî¨ **Scanning a SQL Database**

‚úîÔ∏è **Steps:**

1. **Register your SQL Database** in Purview.
2. Set up a **scan job**, choosing:

   - Which database objects to scan.
   - What **classification rules** to apply.

3. Test your connection and run the scan.
4. Results:

   - Purview will **classify sensitive columns**.
   - Show the **lineage** from stored procedures or pipelines.

---

### üîÅ **Data Lineage Example**

- A stored procedure inserts data from one table to another.
- Purview shows a **visual map** of how the data moved.
- You can track **stored procedure runs, row counts, and execution time**.

### üîê **Authentication Options for Scanning**

| **Auth Method**                      | **Usage**                                                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **System-assigned managed identity** | Simplest option, uses the identity of the Purview account itself. |
| **User-assigned managed identity**   | Similar to system-assigned, but more customizable (in preview).   |
| **Service Principal**                | Good for temporary or automation scenarios.                       |
| **SQL Authentication**               | Least recommended, uses a username and password.                  |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** If using a self-hosted runtime, managed identities don't work‚Äîyou'll need a service principal or SQL auth.

### üåê **When to Use Microsoft Purview**

‚úîÔ∏è You manage data **across Azure, AWS, GCP, on-prem, or SaaS systems**.
‚úîÔ∏è You need **automatic data classification** for compliance (GDPR, HIPAA).
‚úîÔ∏è You want to **catalog and search for data** easily across your entire organization.
‚úîÔ∏è You want to **track data flows** for troubleshooting, auditing, or optimization.

---

### ‚úÖ **Summary**

Microsoft Purview is a powerful governance tool for:

- **Data discovery**
- **Sensitive data classification**
- **Access management**
- **Data lineage tracking**

It helps organizations **understand, secure, and maximize the value of their data** across a hybrid cloud environment.
